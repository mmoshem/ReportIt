# ReportIt â€“ GIS Project

## Background  
Currently, many municipalities lack an efficient way for citizens to report local hazards, leading to delays in addressing issues like potholes or broken streetlights. Existing methods are slow and prone to miscommunication.

## Purpose of the Project  
The goal of this project is to develop a mobile application that enables citizens to easily report hazards to the municipality. Additionally, a web application will be created for municipality staff to view and manage these reports, ensuring faster and more effective resolution of local issues.
